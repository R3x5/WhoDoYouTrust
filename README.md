# WhoDoYouTrust

This repository is not a tutorial, and not a catalog of attack techniques. It reflects how I reason about AD internals at a system and protocol level.

The goal is to describe ***what the system does*** and ***why Kerberos accepts what it accepts***.

## Reading Notes

[This document](https://github.com/R3x5/WhoDoYouTrust/blob/main/Active%20Directory%20Security%20Semantics.md) is often useful if you want a quicker sense of the
level of detail and abstraction used throughout the project.

There is no strict reading order.
Each document is intended to stand on its own,
while sharing a common mental model of AD behavior.

⏳ In Development: This is a living document of understanding, not a finished framework.

🛡️ Educational Purpose: Educational purposes only.
